# Contributing

If you like to add a method (or tweak something), please open a pull-request. We love pull-requests!
But we also love solving issues, so in case you don't really have the time for a pull-request right now,
maybe you can [just tell us what you'd like](https://github.com/Cimpress/coam-client/issues)? 

Or maybe you just feel like [writting us a mail](mailto:TrdelnikSquad@cimpress.io)? Yes, you guessed right, we also love reading mails ;) 

## Pull Requests

Thank you!
